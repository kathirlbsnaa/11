   <hr>
   <p style="color:blue;font-size:15px;">I was born in Maujpur, Delhi. My father used to work as a labourer and 
   we lived in a rented house. When I was five, my two brothers, my parents 
   I moved to Loni, Ghaziabad.<br><br><br> Even though we live so close to Delhi, 
   the area hasn’t developed much due to various political tensions—crime is rampant in Loni and 
   we also don’t have access to good private or public schools.<br><br> However, I managed to finish my schooling. 
   After that I decided to pursue a degree in political science from Delhi University.<br> 
   I have always wanted to learn a lot and go far in life, and help more families like mine who don’t have access to basic necessities.</p>
   <p>I realised that to bring about these changes in Loni I would have to join politics, 
   because political leaders are the people with real power here.</p>

   <p>During my college years I worked with a <b><sub>local political party.</sub></b>
   There I met a <i>well-known political leader from Uttar Pradesh,</i> who, after learning about my economic situation and 
   family background, advised me against pursuing a career in politics. 
   He told me that politics is for those who have time and <del>money</del>sand that I, unfortunately, didn’t have t
   he luxury of either. He suggested I sit for the <mark>UPSC entrance exams</mark> instead.
   Most of my day now goes in studying and preparing for the exam. Simultaneously, 
   I work as a cleaner in the nearby market along with my father and brothers. 
   Both my brothers are younger than me. While one is still pursuing his studies, the other discontinued them after standard <sup>12</sup>  He now helps with housework </p>
